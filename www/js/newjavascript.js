What makes it so important is the fact that both users and search engine depends on them to find your site. Selecting right keywords which matches your content means your site is optimized for showing up in search engine results whenever someone searches for those keywords or phrases. But choosing suitable <span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">keywords is an art. </span><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">It includes figuring out what the people are looking for, so that you can be in the right place, at the right time, with the right content.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/09/top_image_pzlrj.jpg\"></p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Helvetica,Arial,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-size:22px;font-weight:bold\">How to do Keyword Research</span></p>\n<p>Getting your keywords right is almost half the battle won. Targeting right keywords can help you rank high in search engines and drive organic traffic to your site.</p>\n<p>Keyword research is the foundation on which your whole content creation should take place.  As you can’t hit an arrow at a right place without selecting a target, in the same manner, you just can’t start producing content until and unless you know about the keywords that you want to target. Right keywords can make or break a website. </p>\n<p>For example, if you are running an auto blog covering car news, new technology, concepts, launches and targeting keywords like automobile spare parts, it’s not going to work. Why? 99% of the people searching for automobile spare parts will not be interested in your content. On the other hand, the people who are actually searching for the content you cover on regular basis, will not be able to reach you. </p>\n<p>So, it is essential to spend some time analyzing few things before starting keyword research:-</p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Helvetica,Arial,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-size:22px;font-weight:bold\">Keyword Research Strategies</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Helvetica,Arial,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-size:18px;font-weight:bold\">1. Analyze Your Website &amp; Set Your Keyword Goals</span></p>\n<p>Start with making a list of all relevant keywords you can relate your website with. Compile a list of potential keywords &amp; phrases based on your niche and the topics relevant to your site. If you are clear about what your site is and what you want to achieve with it, then keyword selection becomes a much easier process. \n</p>\n<p>To get an idea of what keywords are popular in your niche, you can Google few common keywords that comes to your mind. Google itself shows up few keywords and key phrases powered by ‘Google Sugggest’ feature. The feature is integrated to Google search. If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web History enabled, you might have noticed the drop down list of suggestions from the search box as soon as you start typing, it’s Google Suggest. If you’re not signed in to your Google Account, no history-based suggestions are displayed.</p>\n<p>It also shows you more suggestions at the bottom of the result page to refine your search. For example, if you are searching for wedding dresses, you will get a number of keyword ideas related to the topic.   </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/09/wedding_dresses_google_search_dywwt.png\"></p>\n<h4>Understanding Keywords Types</h4>\n<p>1. It’s advisable to include long tail keywords with your main keywords as they are less competitive and more promising.  Lesser the competition, better the chance it will be ranking on them in the search engines.  For example, if you run a blog on wedding, “black and white wedding dresses” can be a long tail keyword for you.</p>\n<p>2. Focus on specific keywords instead of focusing on broad keywords as they will be responsible for majority of your traffic. For example if you are an automobile spare parts supplier, your broad category could be Maruti, Ford, Honda etc. and your specific category can be spare parts of ford fiesta, spare parts of ford icon etc. There may be thousands of visitors who are searching for ford, but they will not convert into your customer as once they arrive on your site they will realize that they are not looking for this information/spare parts.</p>\n<p><b>TIP:</b> Targeting keywords on the basis of high search volume is not a good idea as the competition level will be much higher on them, which will make it impossible for you to rank on these keywords. </p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Helvetica,Arial,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-size:18px;font-weight:bold\">2. Research Your Audience</span></p>\n<p>Do some research about what your potential audience is looking for. Don’t assume that what you are searching is what your audience searches for. It’s important to target keywords which are relevant to your site to improve your user experience. Ranking for a keyword that is not relevant to your site may attract traffic in the short term, but won’t add add value to your users.</p>\n<p>Browse forums and check social media platforms to see the search terms people are using in their conversations  </p>\n<p>Always think about your audience first. Your top goal should be to provide every user who is coming to your site, what he or she is looking for. \n</p>\n<p><b>TIP:</b> You can ask your friends &amp; family, what they will search for on your targeted topic to get an idea of what your audience might use. </p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Helvetica,Arial,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-size:18px;font-weight:bold\">3. Analyze Your Competitors</span></p>\n<p>Start by learning from the top competitors in your niche. What keywords they are using?The simple way to start is by scanning your competitor’s site pages for their targeted keywords. </p>\n<p>You can also check the search results for your targeted keywords to discover other websites which are already ranking on your keywords. Take first five websites and analyze their keywords to find effective keywords/phrases on your targeted topic.</p>\n<p><b>TIP:</b> To check the authority of the websites appearing in top search results, you can install<a href=\"http://moz.com/tools/seo-toolbar\"> MozBar</a> , SEO toolbar. When you perform a search you will see the domain and page rank for any sites you come across. The domain rank specifies how important the website is with page authority on a 100-point, logarithmic scale.</p>\n<p><b>PRO TIP:</b> If two or more of your competitors are targetting a certain keyword, then use keywords that are associated with it or pick the long tailed versions of it.</p>\n<p>You can do your competitor’s keyword analysis by using few paid tools like <a href=\"http://www.keywordspy.com/\">Keyword Spy</a>,  <a href=\"http://www.spyfu.com/\">SpyFu</a>  and <a href=\"http://www.wordtracker.com/\">Wordtracker</a>.   They will give you detailed reports about your competitors keywords. </p>\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Helvetica,Arial,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-size:18px;font-weight:bold;line-height:1.45em\">4.Use Keyword Tools to Expand Your Keyword List</span>\n</p>\n<p>Use professional keyword research tools to finalize your keywords. Don’t rely on a single keyword tool as each source gets it result from different sources. It is advisable to use different keywords tools to make a comprehensive list. Some of the popular free tools are:</p>\n<h4>Google Keyword Planner</h4>\n<p> Google keyword tool is a favorite among many bloggers.

Strike off the others. Your keyword list might still be large. Now, review your list again to pick 10 to 15 primary keywords you’re going to target. </p>\n<p>Review your list from time to time to check for any trending keywords.</p>\n<p>Keyword research is an ongoing process as the trends keep on changing and so is the competition, so review and renew your keyword research every few months. Try to stay ahead of your competitors by using Google Trends to assess hot topics before anyone else do so. </p>\n<h2>Tips For Finalizing Your Keyword List</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">Target keyword phrases instead of targeting a single keyword</span>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">Use specific targeted terms within the inner pages of your site rather than homepage.</span>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">There are three criteria’s for picking a keyword that is relevancy, traffic and conversion.

Almost everyone, who has an access to internet, has at least one email address. As a digital publisher this is something of business for you. After all this is the most effective way through which you can get your message to reach your target audience and curb a niche of your own. An <a href=\"http://www.betaout.com/blog/9-reasons-why-online-publishers-should-focus-on-building-an-e-mail-list/\">email list</a><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\"> is one of the most important assets for an online business; from publishers to marketers. </span></p>\n<p> Almost 56% of the businesses say they plan to increase their email marketing efforts in 2013. But before doing anything you should have a long enough list of subscribers at your credit to get the maximum benefit out of it. Before starting anything you should remember 25% of your data gets useless every year. Let’s look at few effective ways to grow your email list fast.<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/09/top_image_ashnk.png\" alt=\"Top image\" title=\"Top image\" width=\"705\" height=\"467\"><span></span></p>\n<h2>1. Keep the Subscription Form Very Much Visible</h2>\n<p> Let’s start with the most important thing, the subscription form. Many publishers feel too shy to keep the subscription form visible on the face of the site. Even if they keep it on the site they hide it under the wraps. But if you really want to increase your email list you can’t downplay it. In fact, keep the subscription form on each and every page of your site. </p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">There are two pages which are most visited on a site, the home page and the about us page. For blog sites home page is the most important one. Make sure you have your subscription form right on the Home page, in the first fold itself. You can place it on any side, right or left, but it should be there. For example, popular sites like</span><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\"> </span><a href=\"http://blog.kissmetrics.com/\" style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Kissmetrics</a><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\"> and </span><a href=\"http://www.problogger.net/\" style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Problogger</a><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\"> </span><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">have kept their signup forms on both the left and right  sides, respectively. And both the sites have placed them in the very first fold, as these are the areas which attract the maximum eyeballs.</span></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/09/how_to_grow_your_email_marketing_list_to_5_digits_and_beyond_ke4wd.png\" alt=\"How to Grow Your Email Marketing List to 5 Digits and Beyond\" title=\"How to Grow Your Email Marketing List to 5 Digits and Beyond\" width=\"845\" height=\"241\"><br>\n<span style=\"line-height:1.45em\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Having a signup form isn’t effective enough, make sure you have placed it in the right place so to convert better. Always make sure to keep it absolutely on the top of the side bar, this position does matter a lot in terms of increasing subscription. </span><br>\n You can also place your subscription form on the header or footer bar too. Though there is no guarantee it will get you good results, still you need to do your own testing, as it has also worked very well for many.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/09/problogger_blog_tips_the_blog_problogger_zznd4.png\" alt=\"ProBlogger Blog Tips – The Blog - @ProBlogger\" title=\"ProBlogger Blog Tips – The Blog - @ProBlogger\" width=\"660\" height=\"302\"><br>\n Try to place as many subscription forms as you can, it will help your readers take notice.You should definitely have a form at the bottom of each page too. In fact, putting a signup form under each and every article has turned out to be one of the best conversion places. If a visitor have scrolled down to the end of the article, that means he or she has definitely liked your post. This is the best time when you should ask them to sign-up, and chances of you being successful will be much higher.</p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">You can also add a copy of the subscription form in the comment section too. If someone is trying to comment on your post, it means you have managed to engage the person successfully. It’s the perfect time to capture their data, and it’s extremely popular among the publishers. Most of them ask the reader to sign up, when someone try to comment on a post for the first time. Starting from Huffington post, Problogger to  Kissmetrics,  every one follows this rule.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/09/beloow_the_posst_signup_form_thwt1.png\" alt=\"Beloow  the posst signup form\" title=\"Beloow  the posst signup form\" width=\"850\" height=\"466\">\n</p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">You can even have a light box with a subscription form. This has proved to be a great option for getting more and more readers subscribed. You may think it to be a little annoying for your readers, but try it out first then only decide. Sites like </span> <a href=\"http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/\">SocialMediaExaminer</a>  <span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">have increased their subscription through this method, and there are many more like this one.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/09/lightbox_pglfy.png\" alt=\"Lightbox\" title=\"Lightbox\" width=\"612\" height=\"348\"></p>\n<p> Ask for bare minimum information in the subscription form, in fact just the email id is enough for you to get them signed up. You can gather more information about them later on.</p>\n<h2>2. Produce Quality Content for Your Newsletters</h2>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\"> Getting your visitors subscribe for your newsletter is tough, but the real challenge is in retaining them. The only thing which can retain your subscribers and hold their interest is to create lots of informative and engaging content. Take the example of ‘Moz Top 10’, the newsletter of</span> <a href=\"http://moz.com/blog\">Moz.com</a>. <span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Moz curates and provides its subscribers with the top 10 news coverage of the inbound marketing industry. Similarly, you can also share the links to your own articles in your newsletter to keep you readers on top of your blog coverage.</span></p>\n<p> Tip: 64% of the people have said, they open the mail because of the subject line. So take extra care while crafting subject lines for your newsletters. Ultimately, this is what is going to decide whether it will be trashed or opened.<br>\n<h2>3. Create Value Based ‘Call-to-Action’</h2>\n<p>\n People love to get something for free. Capitalize this human nature to increase your email list. Create a valuable white paper, a guide book or something similar to these which has real value to your new subscriber. Remember, your offer should be extremely compelling so that your audience can not ignore that under any circumstances. The giveaway should be beneficial to your reader. Also make sure you are able to deliver it as promised.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/09/claim_your_free_my_copyblogger_membership_clpfh.png\" style=\"line-height:1.45em\">\n</p>\n<h2>4. Leverage Your Existing Email List</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:normal;font-family:Arial,Helvetica,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">You might have an existing email list with you; leverage it to get more subscribers. You can send them a wake up mail to make them active once again. You can also request them to share it with their friends and peers. And for that make sure you have the social sharing option in your mail and it should be prominently placed in the mail. It has been seen, emails with social sharing buttons have 158% higher click through rate. Also make sure the process is fast and easy. </span></p>\n<h2>5. Use Social Media to Get Subscriptions</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:normal\">You can use social media in various ways to get more subscribers. You can run discussions on your newsletter topics in social media. Share it on LinkedIn and Twitter, share a subscription form on your Facebook page in a customized tab. You can even run contest and share your giveaways on these platforms, where you can ask for their email addresses for registration and seek permission to send them newsletters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:normal\">You can also let the audience do social sign in, where by they will be able to subscribe to your newsletters through their social media login (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn) without creating any separate user account for your site. This is becoming an increasingly popular practice now a days.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/09/forbes_social_login_hldc5.png\"></p>\n<h2>6. Create Multiple Sets of Newsletters to Tap Your Targeted Niche</h2>\n<p> Analyze your email list to understand your audience. You may have audiences with different interests from around the world. They might belong to different time zones too. Create and schedule newsletters keeping all these factors in mind.

And the reason why it still works is because it is the best way to build authority links. Also this most effective off-page strategy is a win win opportunity for both the guest blogger and the host blogger. The guest blogger gets a established platform to get introduced to its target audience. On the other hand, the host blogger gets well researched and high quality content for free. </p>\n<p>However, even <a href=\"http://www.betaout.com/blog/guest-blogging-strategy/\">guest blogging</a> isn’t immune to Google algorithms if not done properly. For example, post Penguin update, bulk guest posting will get you in Google’s bad books. So, here are few tips to create a cult guest blogging strategy in the post Penguin era. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/09/gust_1_sjl6a.jpg\"></p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Helvetica,Arial,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-size:30px;font-weight:700;line-height:38px\">1. Frame a Content Strategy</span><br>\n Just like your content strategy helps you create successful content in a structured manner, guest posting too needs a strategic plan to create relevant content. You have to create absolutely killer content to get your guest post to hit the target. First thing you should do is to scan through the targeted blog thoroughly for its content style. Check the popular guest posts the site already has. Try to create content that is tailored to fit the host blog. One way to ensure that is to do your home work on the voice, tone and theme of the host blog.</p>\n<p>It’s very important to know whom you’re writing for? Choose the topics that’s popular with the host blogger and its audience. An original and compelling article on a subject is most likely to find its audience. \n</p>\n<p>Also, create post on topics closely related to your blog niche. Instead of targeting any particular keyword, target a range of related key words or key phrase.</p>\n<p> Tip: Do not publish duplicate content or reuse old content as it can have a negative impact on both your own and the host blog. Create unique and relevant content for your guest post.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Helvetica,Arial,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-size:30px;font-weight:700;line-height:38px\">2. Create an Editorial Calendar</span><br>\n<span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">Creating original and quality content is a time consuming process. Guest post too demands a good amount of time from your already busy schedule. Before you commit to write a guest post, check out whether your own publishing schedule will be able to accommodate it or not, as you can’t do it at the cost of your own publication. </span>\n</p>\n<p>Once you have decided upon your target blogs, start brainstorming for the probable topics to organize your blogging efforts. Jot down all your ideas at one place, with reference points and thoughts around it. <a href=\"http://www.betaout.com/blog/10-reasons-why-every-publisher-needs-an-editorial-calendar/\" style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Create an editorial calendar</a><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">  to manage the whole thing effectively along with your own publication requirements. Thinking ahead will not make you more productive, but will also help you produce higher quality content.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Helvetica,Arial,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-size:30px;font-weight:700;line-height:38px\">3. Follow the Guest Post Guidelines</span></p>\n<p> Many blogs and publications have pre-set guidelines for the guest bloggers. Go through them thoroughly. This will help you frame the story structure correctly and minimize the chance of your post getting rejected. Guest post guidelines generally contain information regarding:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Content expectation</span>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Tone and style of the guest post</span>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Format of the post</span>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Information related to the editorial process</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The guest post guidelines will also influence your content strategy, so pay heed to them before getting your post ready. For example, big publications like Copyblogger prefers content which can benefit their readers like advanced tips, where as Problogger keeps it more open by accepting good quality content on targeted topics. </p>\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Helvetica,Arial,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-size:30px;font-weight:700;line-height:38px\">4. Choose a Topic Related to the Theme of Your Blog</span><br>\n Always choose a topic for guest posting which can easily be streamlined with the theme of your own blog. Remember your ultimate goal is to appeal to the target audience in your niche. This will also give you a chance to add a linkback to your own blog. Considering the audience is already interested in the topic, it won’t require too much effort on your part to turn them into your repeated visitors.<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">Not to forget, it should comfortably fit in a particular category of the host blog too. For example, if you are a beauty blogger you can choose a fashion topic for guest blogging. Here you will easily be able to link back to couple of your own articles while talking about relevant make-up tips.</span>\n</p>\n<p><b>Tip: </b>Look for the topics your target audience is demanding, choose one of them which suits your blog theme the most.\n</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Helvetica,Arial,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-size:30px;font-weight:700;line-height:38px\">5. Focus on Creating Original and Unique Content</span></p>\n<p> There is a tendency of the guest bloggers to spin their old articles. Don’t do this mistake ever. It will ruin your impression permanently. You might be thinking why to spend much time after a post which will be published on others site? Now think of it in a different way, this is the post which is going to introduce you to your potential audience. So you need to put your best foot forward to win them over. This will also help you in getting your content published easily.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Helvetica,Arial,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-size:30px;font-weight:700;line-height:38px\">6. Proof Read Your Post</span></p>\n<p> Now a days, bloggers and publishers have become pickier than ever. Always make sure to edit your guest post before submitting it. Remember it’s not the publishers’ responsibility to check the mistakes and refine it to make it publish ready. </p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">A post with silly mistakes shows lack of sincerity on your part. On the other hand, it also harms your credibility. Try to revise your article multiple times to check the spelling and grammar, minimize the use of wrong vocabulary, and check the story flow. Do the proof reading and then only submit the final draft. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">If you are not comfortable copy editing your own story, take help from the professionals. In fact you can use online copy editing tools to make your piece of content error free. There are many free tools available online to make editing easier for you, like </span><a href=\"http://www.grammarly.com/\" style=\"line-height:1.45em;outline:0px\">Grammerly</a><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\"> </span><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">and </span><a href=\"http://www.spellchecker.net/\" style=\"line-height:1.45em;outline:0px\">SpellChecker</a> <span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">for grammar and spelling check, </span><a href=\"http://wordweb.info/free/\" style=\"line-height:1.45em\">WordWeb</a> <span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">to help you out with right vocabulary, </span><a href=\"http://paperrater.com/\">PaperRater</a> <span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">to suggest you appropriate title and do the proof reading work for you and so on. </span></p>\n<p>Also don’t forget to run your content through a plagiarism checker, even one percent plagiarism is good enough to get your article rejected outrightly. There are many plagiarism checking softwares available in the market. For example, <a href=\"http://www.copyscape.com/\" style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Copyscape</a><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">, </span><a href=\"http://www.plagiarismchecker.com/\" style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Plagiarismchecker</a><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">, </span><a href=\"http://www.plagium.com/\" style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Plagium</a><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\"> </span><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">etc. are the best plagiarsim checker tools available.</span></p>\n<p><b>Tip:</b> Don’t do the editing while composing or right after finishing it. Come back to it some time later.  Many a times it happens that you tend to skip silly mistakes while editing a post immediately after composing it, where as you easily detect them later.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Helvetica,Arial,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-size:30px;font-weight:700;line-height:38px\">7. Get the Anchor Text Right</span><br>\n Guest posting is the new link building strategy post panda and penguin. But anchor text has become a big concern after Google Panda and Penguin. SEO practitioners of the pre Panda era have abused the anchor texting practice to such an extent that it took the whole blogging concept to the verge of getting devalued. Google webmaster guidelines on anchor text links is clearly against any manipulation including too much focus on keyword-rich anchor text links. So, remember to:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Use meaningful text for anchor text links</span>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Don’t use words like ‘read more’, ‘here’ etc. in the post for linking back</span>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Link back to landing pages optimized for that blog’s audience</span>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Don’t use the same keywords and keyphrases for linking back</span>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Too many articles that are all optimized for the same set of keywords is a big no no</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Tip: </b> If the host platform has an author bio plugin installed, then go for linking your site from there to build credibility. Don’t include more than one or two links.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Helvetica,Arial,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-size:30px;font-weight:700;line-height:38px\">8. Choose Sites with Maximum Comments</span><br>\n Try to find out blogs which have maximum number of comments on their articles. Target these blogs to get your posts published on. It’s been seen, comments are directly proportionate to the increased referral traffic to your blog.<span style=\"line-height:1.45em\"> </span><a href=\"http://www.betaout.com/blog/the-art-of-building-communities-through-comments/\" style=\"line-height:1.45em\">More comments means more active community</a><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">,</span><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\"> where you can get those passionate and active readers. </span></p>\n<p><b>Tip: </b>Instead of the top-notch sites in your niche, also consider writing guest posts for smaller but good blogs in your industry with active communities. Writing for them will take less time but will help you establish your reach quickly.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Helvetica,Arial,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-size:30px;font-weight:700;line-height:38px\">9. Reply to the Comments</span></p>\n<p> As a publisher you must be busy for sure, but make sure to check the comments you get on your guest post. Try to respond back and get into conversation if possible. This will help you to connect with this new set of readers. It’s not necessary to acknowledge each and every one individually all the time, but make sure to get back with an answer if you are asked a question or any kind of clarification. This will help you enhance your credibility and get exposure in the first place. If you’ll give importance to your audience they will return you the favor with their visit on your blog site. </p>\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Helvetica,Arial,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-size:30px;font-weight:700;line-height:38px\">10. Promote Your Post on Social Media</span><br>\n Most of the publishers use guest blogging for promotional purpose. If you really want to get maximum out of it, do promote the article once it gets published. Own your content. The more these articles will get exposure, better it is for you. But for that you have to help yourself by promoting the guest post for the host blog. You can do it in many ways:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Indulge in discussions on similar topics on other blogs and forums</span>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Link it back in your future posts</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On many occasions, the host blogger also does promotion for the guest post. A synergic effort will definitely help in achieving better response in the form of likes, shares, tweets etc. Social signals play a huge role in improving your search engine rankings and earning credibility with the audience on social media platforms. </p>\n<p>\n Finally, use guest blogging as a part of your overall SEO strategy. Guest post is one of the most effective ways to market yourself with zero investment. Use it to build both links and a brand name for yourself.\n</p>\n<p>       </p>", "categories": ["Content Strategy", "Editorial Calendar", "Publishing", "SEO", "guest blog", "guest blogging", "Guest Blogging Strategy", "guest post", "guest posting"]}, {"title": "13 Crucial Steps to Creating a Strong Social Media Community", "link": "http://www.betaout.com/blog/tips-to-enhance-your-social-presence/", "author": "Anuradha Sarkar", "publishedDate": "Thu, 05 Sep 2013 03:48:32 -0700", "contentSnippet": "According to a report released by eMarketer, “Worldwide Social Network Users: 2013 Forecast and Comparative Estimates” one in ...", "content": "<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/09/increase_your_presence_in_social_media_sites_wynr2.jpg\" alt=\"Increase-your-Presence-in-Social-Media-Sites\" title=\"Increase-your-Presence-in-Social-Media-Sites\" width=\"630\" height=\"300\"></p>\n<p>According to a report released by eMarketer, “Worldwide Social Network Users: 2013 Forecast and Comparative Estimates” one in four people worldwide are using social media. To be more precise, among 2.7 billion of the total internet population, a whopping 1.73 billion are expected to be on social networking sites by the end of 2013. \n<p></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">Modern publishers are quick to realize the importance of using social media to grow audience and on-site engagement. After all, it makes sense to be present where your audience is. But with the increasing number of users adopting social media to discover relevant content, the publishers need to be proactive to stand out from the crowd and  build a community around their content on the social media networks. </span></p>\n<p><span></span><br>\n<h2><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">1. Optimize Your Social Media Profile </span></h2>\n</p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">It’s always better to start from the basics. Complete your site’s social media profile to attract potential followers . A complete social media profile says a lot about your brand. Incomplete profiles may do more harm than good to a brand’s credibility. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Do a thorough profile assessment across all the social media platforms you are present on. Analyze your profile’s strengths and weaknesses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Now a days, social media profiles and updates shows up in search results as “Rich Snippet.” So try to optimize your profile information with targeted keywords and appropriate key phrases to be found in the search results. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">2. Listen to Your Community</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Your social media followers could become your brand advocates. So, listen to your fan base. Try to gage the likes and dislikes of your audience by checking out the most popular content on your site. For example, it might be the content that has got maximum likes and shares. This should give you an idea of which content resonates best with your audience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">Always pay attention to what people are saying about your publication on the social media networks. It can be good or bad comments or a simple feedback.</span><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em;font-size:15px\">An effective social listening will also help you in:</span></p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Identifying your social influencers</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Identifying popular trends</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Getting innovative content ideas</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Getting ideas for better audience engagement </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">3. Tailored Approach for Each Platform</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Social media is all about engaging your audience. Merely sharing links to your articles across all platforms isn’t going to work.</span><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">Never post the same news across different platforms. Instead tailor your social sharing to generate as much engagement as you can on each of these platforms. For example, Twitter demands succinct &amp; enticing headlines, while a compelling and story telling approach performs better on Facebook &amp; Instagram.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">4. Running Social Media Contests </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\"> Social media contests is a tried and tested way to capture new readers.

So make sure the type of contest you have chosen fits your social strategy and your goals. Once you have set goals, you need to monitor the contest to see if you are meeting them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\"><b>Tip:</b> Remember to make it easy to enter. Ask for as little information as possible to encourage more and more participation.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">5. Using Pictures to Amplify Your Message</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">It’s a proven fact that people get more attracted towards visual graphics.

Platforms like Pinterest, Instagram etc. have grown into thriving communities built around images. Stats say, posts with pictures are likely to get 53% more likes. So, include more images in your post to attract maximum eye balls.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/09/fox_traveller_jrp1d.png\" alt=\"FOX Traveller\" title=\"FOX Traveller\" width=\"850\" height=\"404\"><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\"><br></span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\"><b>6.

Use Hashtags to Get More Traction </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Using hastags properly can enrich your social media participation. Using a unique and relevant ‘#’ in your tweet or Facebook update has the potential to attract potential audiences from around the world. Hashtags are searchable and clickable, making the relevant content that has been tagged easy to discover. The phenomenon was initially started by Twitter and is currently being used on almost all the big social media platforms including, Facebook, Google+, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/09/twitter_53g7b.png\" alt=\"Twitter\" title=\"Twitter\" width=\"845\" height=\"157\"><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\"><br></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">You can use # tags at the end of your post or set as a prefix in your social media updates. Apart from this, you can also fix a hashtag for a particular event for enhanced outreach. For example, any picture on Instagram gets more views and likes if the title contains a hashtag.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">9. Be Human</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Your audience should be able to connect with you on a personal level. For that, your activities and conversations have to be more real and human-centric. </span><br>\nMake sure to reply to each<br>\nand every thoughtful comment to make your readers feel valued and recognized. </p>\n<p>Foster<a href=\"http://www.betaout.com/blog/the-art-of-building-communities-through-comments/\"> community<br>\naround your comments</a>  &amp; discussions. <span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">The biggest mistake a social media manager can make is to copy paste canned answers in reply of a comment. Also, pre written replies always don’t comply with the context of a conversation. You have to make real connections with each interaction you have, and for that you need to take actions in real time. </span><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">Value the time your fans/followers have taken out to connect with your brand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Ultimately, it’s all about being social and building relationships.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">10. Incentivize Your Fans </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">To retain and increase the enthusiasm, start appreciating your followers individually. Highlight your loyal fans who are consistently adding value to your social media communities. </span><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">Acknowledge each and every<br>\ncontributor with something more than “Thanks”, make it a little personalized,<br>\nthis will encourage them to participate in future too.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">You can also incentivize them for their participation by implementing a thin-layer of gamification on your site. </span><a href=\"http://www.betaout.com/blog/8-tips-to-create-a-killer-gamification-strategy/\" style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">Gamification strategies</a><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\"> </span><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\"> can boost your social media participation.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">11. Post at Regular Intervals</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Your posts and updates should be targeted towards your audience. So it’s very important for you to understand when your audiences are active on the platforms and your posts should be scheduled accordingly. Not only this, each of your posts should get the necessary consumption time too. If you keep sharing article links continuously, it will not be effective enough. Rather it will look like you are flooding your fans’ timelines.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Analyze your audience reaction to your posts to find out the best time for sending updates. There are many tools available in the market to help you out in behavioral data analysis. It’s also natural for you to have followers from different time zones but you can’t be active all the time. Best you can do is to create and schedule posts in preferred intervals. Plan timely updates with social media scheduling tools like </span><a href=\"http://bufferapp.com/\">Buffer</a> <span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">, </span><a href=\"http://tweetdeck.com/\">Tweetdeck</a> <span style=\"line-height:1.45em\"> etc.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">12. Integrate Your Social Media Presence with Your Overall Strategy </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Integrating social media activities with all other online community building activities is extremely crucial. It will not only create more visibility but will also give your audience a chance to share your content with others. This will help you reach a remote set of audience with ease.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Add social sharing option to each and every page of your website, attach your social ids to all your distribution modes, including email newsletters and press releases. Also attach them to your digital signatures to make it more credible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">It becomes very difficult to manage multiple accounts at a time. You can use social media integration tools to make it easy for you. </span><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">There are services like </span><a href=\"https://hootsuite.com/\">HootSuite</a> <span style=\"line-height:1.45em\"> and </span><a href=\"http://sproutsocial.com/\">Sproutsocial</a> <span style=\"line-height:1.45em\"> which let you manage your multiple social media accounts under one interface.</span></p>\n<h2>13. Establish Social Media Performance Metrics</h2>\n<p>It’s always important to measure the effectiveness of your social media activities. You can’t blindly work towards a goal. Most publishers overlook the importance of managing their social media efforts. But without fixed goals &amp; objectives, any strategy is bound to fail. <br><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/09/metrics_pxi44.png\" alt=\"Metrics\" title=\"Metrics\" width=\"733\" height=\"321\"><br>Always establish performance metrics for each of the social media networks you are striving to build a community on. For example, it could be:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Number of fans and followers</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Engagement around your posts</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Social mentions and shares</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Unique and Repeated visitors</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The rule of thumb says, how you measure engagement will depend on how you define engagement in the first place. </p>\n<p>Don’t mistake the social networks for a community. Adding social sharing buttons isn’t all, you need to come up with a real plan to build real communities. </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\"><br></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">Image Credit: </span><a href=\"http://seorise.co.uk\" style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">SeoRise</a><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">,</span><a href=\"http://www.socialbakers.com\" style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">Socialbakers</a><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\"> </span></p>\n", "categories": ["Social Media", "online community", "Social media", "social media tips", "social networks"]}, {"title": "How to Use Guest Blogging to Build Traffic & Expand Reach", "link": "http://www.betaout.com/blog/guest-blogging-strategy/", "author": "Anuradha Sarkar", "publishedDate": "Mon, 02 Sep 2013 05:49:06 -0700", "contentSnippet": "Guest blogging is an old standby in the SEO book which has stood the test of times and is still considered as one of the best ...", "content": "<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/09/1_wicpg_dhjfp.jpg\"></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">Guest blogging is an old standby in the SEO book which has stood the test of times and is still considered as one of the best practices to build your online brand.

In fact it’s a high commitment job. It requires your valuable time to formulate a strategy, build the relationship and most importantly create a well researched post of supreme quality on a relevant topic which is not even going to get posted on your own site. Its pretty natural to get scrupulous about the real worth of it. Let’s see how it helps:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/09/2_qdtes.jpg\"></p>\n<h3>1. Create Brand Awareness</h3>\n<p>It’s always difficult to get the initial traction. Specially at a point of time when the field is already crowded with bloggers targeting the same niche as yours. <br>\n” As per a survey, there are 42,000,000 Blogs in the US alone.”<br>\nIn the prevailing scenario, guest blogging gives you an opportunity to create noise where the audience is already present. It not only helps you in brand visibility but it also helps you in improving the credibility of your content.</p>\n<h3>2. Driving Referral Traffic</h3>\n<p>Guest blogging on the authority sites in your niche is a great way to drive referral traffic to your site. Most importantly, it’s already a group of people who are interested in your topic, so turning them into repeated visitors is comparatively easier this way.</p>\n<h3>3. Earn Back Links</h3>\n<p>“When it comes to SEO, guest posting on other sites is five times as valuable as creating new content on your own site.”<br>\nGuest blogging is great for the health of your sites’ organic SEO. Besides creating brand awareness, it also fetches you much desired authority back links for your site. Backlinks are the real currency of the web. Earlier SEO experts used to indulge into various malpractices of buying links for a site, but with recent Google updates, all those link trading and other similar practices have taken a hit. Getting backlinks from other authority sites in your niche is now more important than ever before. Cumulatively, these back links will help you a lot in getting a higher search engine rank in a comparatively small span of time.\n<div>\n<h3><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">4. Networking with Other Bloggers</span></h3>\n<p>Building a network is a key to the success in the blogosphere. Guest blogging is a great way to start your blogger outreach program and build relationships with your fellow publishers. If your article manages to get good response on their site, they will definitely get back to you for more. And, if any of the leading bloggers or publishers tweet about your guest post or even retweet your article on their social media platforms, which they mostly do, it will further help you in getting exposure to their huge followers base. This will add to the bit of your marketing which is not bad. You also can mention some of the leading bloggers in your post and drop them a note, which will open your way to approach them in future. This kind of professional relationship can accelerate the growth of your blog potentially.<br>\n<h2>How to start with Guest Blogging?</h2>\n<p>Now when you have enough reasons to start with guest blogging, the big question appears- How to start? Most of the publishers and bloggers have a perception that it’s all about creating a post, submitting it to other publishers and get them publish. Somehow similar to what they do on their own blogs.<br>\nBut this is not really going to work. Specially keeping in view the steep competition and ever growing complexity in the field of guest blogging, you need to work out a strategic plan to achieve desired results. Start with writing your goals.</p></p></div>\n<div>\n<h2><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">What’s your guest blogging Goal? </span></h2>\n<p>Ask yourself what exactly you want to achieve through guest blogging. What are the objectives you want to full fill through this? Within what time frame you want to see the result? Whether it’s a short term venture or you want to continue with it? Some of the things you might be looking forward to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Creating brand awareness</span>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Expanding your reach</span>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Increasing readership of your blog </span>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Getting authority back links</span>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Building connections with fellow bloggers and industry leaders</span>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You may also do it just to try your hand in different topics and styles or purely to add it to your portfolio. It can be anything but it has to be definite. This is extremely crucial for chalking out the whole plan as everything will be decided keeping the goal in mind.</p>\n<p><b style=\"line-height:1.45em\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Helvetica,Arial,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-size:30px;line-height:38px\">How to Select Blogs for Guest Blogging? </span></b></p>\n<p>It will take a lot of your time, energy and effort to create a high quality, relevant blog post which will be of value for the host blog. You can’t afford to start sending articles to every other blog accepting guest articles. You have to strategically search and churn out few blogs from your niche, which should not essentially be identical to your blog topic but related to it or something which interests you. Here’s what you need to do to find authority blogs in your niche:-\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">You might have them in your RSS. These can be the ones you regularly follow, try them out if they have the provision for guest posts</span>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">You can also visit the sites like <a href=\"http://myblogguest.com/\">MyBlogGuest</a>, <a href=\"https://www.guestbloggenius.com/\">Guest Blog Genius</a>, <a href=\"http://www.postjoint.com/\">PostJoint</a> which specifically cater to the needs of those looking for guest blogging opportunities</span>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Search on Twitter with accurate phrases related to guest blogging opportunity and follow the real time updates to get the desired result. You can conduct the search on other popular social media sites to find out the latest buzz on the topic</span>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Go to Google, select ‘Blogs’ or ‘Discussion’ option and find out the most ‘talked about’ sites</span>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">You can go to Google and try to search “Top 10 blogs” of your niche, or randomly search with other related keywords to get the result</span>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">You can also check their Alexa rank as it has fairly good search rankings system</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/09/2_r2yze.jpg\" alt=\"2\" title=\"2\" width=\"794\" height=\"478\">\n</p>\n<p>Make a mixed list, where you have the top blogs of your niche, also the ones which have a growing readership base but don’t rank very high in popularity or search engine result. In general try to target those blogs with any of the following characteristics:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">An impressive readership base</span>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">High page ranks in general</span>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Active community both on site and social media</span>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">An audience demography of common interest</span>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>Tip:</b> Try to reach out to the industry leaders or the publishers who have never accepted guest posts on their blogs. Approach them with a compelling proposal and offer something of great value. If you crack through them you’ll get the extra benefit for sure.<br>\n<h2><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Helvetica,Arial,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-size:30px;font-weight:700;line-height:38px\">How to Approach Other Bloggers for Guest Posts? </span></h2>\n<p>Once you have zeroed in on the prospective blog sites you want to write for, you have to frame a strategy to reach out to them. There are blogs which have a predefined process for the guest bloggers to submit their posts. All you have to do is, to follow the steps and guidelines carefully and you are done with your submission. <br>\nIt becomes a hard nut to crack, when there are no particular guidelines available for the guest bloggers except from a contact email ID. You have to be tactful when approaching this kind of bloggers. Remember they might receive 10s or 100s of mails every day with a guest blogging request, you have to stand out in the crowd to win the opportunity. Study the host blog thoroughly to get a good understanding of its style, topicality and quality of the published content. Think how you can contribute to the blog for its best and communicate your thought in a convincing manner, keeping the content expectation in mind.\n<p> \n</p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\"><b>Tip:</b></span><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\"> You can promote their articles on your own social media pages, which can help you get noticed.

The problem is not with the Gamification concept itself, but the way people design their game mechanics. </p>\n<p>The real value is in engaging and motivating your users at a deeper level.  Your game design should be based on your users journey. Every stage needs an understanding of users’ needs and desires and how you can give them a compelling experience. </p>\n<p>Read some of the tips &amp; tricks for a winning <a href=\"http://www.betaout.com/blog/10-proven-gamification-strategies-for-publishers-to-maximize-engagement/\">gamification strategy</a> :</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/08/gamification_dffvi.jpg\"></p>\n<p><span></span><br>\n<h2><b>1. Your Game Mechanics Should Drive Behavioral Changes</b></h2>\n<p>Implementing gamification techniques doesn’t means it has to be a complete game. Your game mechanics shouldn’t just be for fun. It should be deeply integrated with your goals &amp; strategies.</p>\n<p>The main aim of applying game mechanics is to enhance the whole user experience to drive positive behavioral changes in users. Motivating them to interact more with your content and take specific actions as desired by you.</p>\n<p>Most people get caught up in engaging the user without focusing on specific outcomes. So, evaluate your game mechanics.</p>\n<p>Gamification should help your users to interact X number of times more than they would in a non-gamified system.</p>\n<h2><b>2. Design the User Journey through Different Levels</b></h2>\n<p>Your game design should be designed for engaging users throughout the user journey funnel: where they are, what they will want to achieve next and so on.</p>\n<h3><b>Tips for Onboarding New Users </b></h3>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">When building a community, the focus is on getting new members onboard. Initially, offer simple quests with a liberal point system. For example, “Like” a piece of content or “Share” content.</span>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">Give them welcome points when they come onboard.</span>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">Let them play for a while and accumulate some points before asking them to join.</span>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But the process shouldn’t stop at signing up. Your strategy should also guide them on what they are expected to do next to get promoted to the next level.</p>\n<p>A little handholding will go a long way in giving them a sense of belonging to the community.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:20px;line-height:20px\"><b>Personalised Engagement</b></p>\n<p>Engagement is the most powerful metrics in Web 3.0.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/08/jobs_500px_owpgo.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Nielsen research says, “The truth is people don’t read very much , often scanning text instead of really reading it.”</p>\n<p>So, you need to deliver a compelling, optimized site experience to keep your readers engaged. <span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">For example, you might have noticed “Recommended for You” box on various blogs and websites. This personalization trend was first started by Amazon and was widely adopted by publishers to help their readers in discovering more content.</span></p>\n<p>A good game design should guide a novice user towards mastery while ensuring he doesn’t lose interest in between. </p>\n<p style=\"font-size:20px;line-height:20px\"><b>Retaining Users</b></p>\n<p>Retention is crucial. You focus should be on turning your users into brand evangelists. Giving too much too quickly won’t keep it interesting for the top users. Once the user is at the top, what’s next.</p>\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\"></span></p>\n<p>An old joke making rounds in gamification circles goes as, “Give less rewards to users who are more active and more rewards to users who are less active.”</p>\n<h2><b>3. Focus on intrinsic rewards more than extrinsic rewards</b></h2>\n<p>Choose your rewards carefully. Too much cash stuff might quickly fetch you a lot of eyeballs but the readers will lurk around just for the contests and giveaways.</p>\n<p>“There will be many to date but none to marry.”</p>\n<p>You got to find a balance between cash &amp; free products and intrinsic rewards. such as unlocking a limited edition badge, early access to content,</p>\n<p><b>“Badges and leaderboards could be considered the new sweepstakes and loyalty rewards,”</b><b>- Darren Steele, Mindspace.</b></p>\n<p>The game mechanics should offer some inherent value to a user—even if that value is a feeling of goal completion, self-esteem or pride.</p>\n<p>For example, Quora works on “Voting” as its main game mechanics. Votes offer validation. Higher votes means the user is considered an expert.</p>\n<p>Badges should tie directly into your business goals and to what users care about and are proud of. Only then earning badges will <span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">provide the sense of achievement and encourage users to take a specific action to earn them. </span><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">A game mechanic should deepen user’s engagement with your site.</span></p>\n<h2><b>4. Keep your Game Mechanics Simple</b></h2>\n<p>It’s not the game but the game mechanics that will have an impact on productivity.</p>\n<p>Gamification mechanics should be simple to understand. A real game mechanic is short and specific – one kind of action leading to one kind of outcome. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/08/4a3315ad301544fcbe67c182e4957660_h5uoh.png\"></p>\n<p>For Example, National Post has explained its mechanics as simple actions or rules with well defined rewards.</p>\n<p>If your user doesn’t know which of his actions are getting him points or new badges then perhaps he won’t be motivated to earn more. All the levels and badges in the world won’t help you retain a confused user.</p>\n<h2><b>5. Keep it Real – Tie Your PBL with Bigger Interests</b></h2>\n<p>Foursqaure killed it with too many badges, mayorships. At one point, its top users stopped caring about earning a “Mayor” status. Once the user is at the top, they will soon drift away.</p>\n<p>Design your loyalty program or rewards keeping this in mind. Is the user getting any benefit at all?</p>\n<p>Foursquare realized that its gaming system has to do more than giving the badges. So they started offering recommendation for local stores and restaurants, discounts, tips, etc. on user check-ins.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/08/b5738cbd39b84487b8403d4cc1f3d2b9_zbzxt.png\"></p>\n<p>Similarly, Frequent Flyer Programs aren’t valuable for collecting miles alone. Airlines gamify travel by designing Loyalty Programs to redeem acquired miles for free air travel; discounts or for increased benefits.</p>\n<h2><b>6. Get Social – Marry Your Game Design with Social Media</b></h2>\n<p>Your game design should be inherently social. Your game mechanics should be seamlessly integrated with the social media.</p>\n<p>Ecommerce companies are doing it right by offering recruiter points to their customers for inviting their friends to sign up. For example, you will be incentivized by a discount on your friend’s first sale.</p>\n<p>For example, Groupon’s “Refer-a-Friend” program. <a href=\"http://www.shopify.com/\">Shopify</a>  s referral program offer “Refer 5 Friends to Shopify – and Your Store is Free!”</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/08/4e66d125232a40a0accefa7d8f819f01_x8wpv.png\"></p>\n<p>Encourage your users to share their achievements on social media. This will not only make your user feel good but will also motivate his friends to join your site as well.</p>\n<h2><b>7. Hire Good Designers and UX Guys</b></h2>\n<p>A lot of gamified applications fail to meet their business objectives primarily because of poor design.</p>\n<p>Gamification is all about enhancing user experience (UX). A designer who is familiar with the subject can immediately start thinking about how a user and game play might converge. And if it’s poorly balanced, the user will generally have a poor user experience.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/08/4434e8b427534d3da658037f69e02aef_zqnuu.png\"></p>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"http://nwplyng.com/\">#Nwplyng</a>  a music app for iOS and Android has designed their badges to look like records to make their gamification relevant. <span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">There are also special Artist records which a user can earn on sharing.</span></p>\n<h2><b>8. And Don’t forget Bartle’s Character Theory</b></h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/08/097e53f29790452ca73c0d4a2199d32d_rfg6f.png\"></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">The best gamification is audience-specific. Bartle’s Player Types theory has classified types of gamers into 4 types; Killer, Achiever, Socialiser and  Explorer.</span>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">Killers thrive on competition</span>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">Achievers want to accomplish and complete</span>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">Explorers want to discovers stuff</span>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">Socialisers participate for the social aspect, rather than to play the game itself.</span>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can also adopt a player-centric approach depending on your gamification objectives, but at times, your users can display mixed traits. The player types are not limited to Bartle’s Player Types theory. So it is very important to identify your audience, metrics which appeal to them the most and the actions they are performing on your site to make decisions about your game design. </p>\n<p>Adopt a player centered approach to enable meaningful engagement in all aspects of design. For example, the majority of FarmVille audience are ‘socializers.’</p>\n<p><b>“Gamification is 75% Psychology and 25% Technology.”–Gabe Zichermann</b></p>\n<p>Gamification isn’t a magic pill. Adding few points, few badges and a leaderboard won’t help you take the leap. Designing an effective and captivating gameplay need a thoughtful strategy. But you also need to learn by testing out different versions and learning which one engages your users the most.</p>\n<p>Also check out <a href=\"http://www.betaout.com/blog/gamification-for-publishers/\">Gamification Guide for Publishers</a>.</p>\n<p>Image Credit: <a href=\"http://frankcaron.com/\" style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">FrankCaron</a><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\"> </span></p></p>", "categories": ["Gamification", "Game mechanics", "gamification", "gamification tips", "Gaming"]}, {"title": "On-Page Vs Off-Page Optimization in Social Media Age", "link": "http://www.betaout.com/blog/on-page-vs-off-page-optimization-whats-the-diffrence/", "author": "Anuradha Sarkar", "publishedDate": "Mon, 26 Aug 2013 07:08:02 -0700", "contentSnippet": "On page and off page optimization are two most touted words in the field of search engine optimization.

Though the on-page vs off-page debate is as old as Google, it is still an area of constant debate. But the truth is both are vital to the success of an online business. Though the world of SEO has changed forever with the evolution of social media, it is very important for online businesses to understand the relevance of these two processes in order to get organic traffic from search engines.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/08/2_dlknj.png\"> </p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p>On page and off page optimization are the first and most important steps towards your website’s search engine optimization. In simple words, on page and off page activities help your websites get found by the search engines whenever somebody searches with particular keywords or key phrases relevant to your site.  Both the activities are driven towards achieving the same goal but the ways are different.</p>\n<h2>On page Optimization</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">On-Page SEO refers to how well your website’s content is presented to search engines. On page optimization involves ensuring whether a particular webpage is structured in a manner so that it gets found by the search engines for given keywords and key phrases. It not only helps in getting good search engine ranking but also increases overall readability of the site. The best part is that not much has changed about the on-page optimization approach. It <span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">can still be improved immediately by tweaking incorrect elements on a webpage.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">There 5 key elements of a successful on page optimization.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/08/a5cddd5026e649fd8f03e24b267b383d_jrbm2.png\" width=\"449\" height=\"443\"></p>\n<h3>1. Page copy</h3>\n<p>A good content copy is really the key to your success. It is an open secret that you need to produce original, unique and high quality content of relevance on a continuous basis to perform well and rank high on search engines. There are few things you need to keep in mind while creating the content copy.</p>\n<h4>Keyword</h4>\n<p>Each piece of content should be created keeping the focus primarily on a single keyword or a key phrase. This word or phrase should at least be mentioned for a specific number of times in the whole content and this process is known as keyword density. Each content copy is supposed to maintain a keyword density of 3-5% as par industry standard. Keep a mix of primary and secondary keywords and key phrases in your content but optimize your content around only those keywords and phrases on which you desire to achieve top organic search rankings.</p>\n<h4>Quality over quantity</h4>\n<p>You don’t essentially need longer articles for better search engine rankings. Web pages with more content intensity and depth has started performing better on search engine ranking since the 2011 Google algorithm update.</p>\n<h3>2. Title Tags</h3>\n<p>Arguably title tag is the most important element among the “big three”, the other two being page copy and inbound links. Title tag contains the words which appear in the clickable link of the search engine result. Google has limited the page titles up to 70 characters, so it is extremely important that your title tags are keyword-relevant yet concise. For example, when  looking up in Google for a query, you might have noticed the chopped off title tags in few results, that’s because the title tags for that page are too long. To optimize the title tags primary key words and secondary keywords should be mentioned in the same order and the branded keywords at the end, this is a rule to follow except for the home page.</p>\n<h3>3. Meta Data</h3>\n<p>Meta data is a well written description summarizing the content of a particular webpage. It used to be one of the most important factors affecting search engine optimization in pre-Panda era. Meta data completely lost it’s importance in influencing Search Engine rankings from September, 2009 after Google’s declaration. It was majorly devalued because of a wide practice of spam techniques. Google crawlers though look at the Meta keywords to get an idea about the topicality of the page content. Meta descriptions have to be created within a limit of 155- 160 characters which essentially should not include anything  but alphanumeric characters. It can’t influence search engine rankings but do help in getting a high click through rate.</p>\n<p>Meta description works more as an ad copy for the organic search results which influences the readers to click on a particular link. It can also intelligently accommodate the primary keywords within it, Google specially highlights them if searched key phrase contains the exact key words.</p>\n<h3>4. Heading Tags</h3>\n<p>These are the tags which define the content of your page section wise, just like traditional headings and subheadings. There should be one &lt;h1&gt; tag every page, which should include the most relevant key phrase or key word. This tag can be created uptill &lt;h6&gt;, though general practice is to use this till &lt;h3&gt;.</p>\n<p>Apart from the primary key word mentioned in the &lt;h1&gt;, you can include the other important keyphrases in &lt;h2&gt; and &lt;h3&gt; tags to define the other sections of the content. The &lt;h1&gt; tag should be optimized well as search engines still give this some value.</p>\n<h3>5. Interlinking</h3>\n<p>Strategically, linking one of your website pages to other similar pages on your website provides context to the search engine and to the readers as well. Some best practices are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Include links in main content of each page.</li>\n<li>Paragraph links carry the most weight.</li>\n<li>Use keyword-rich anchor text in links.</li>\n<li>Avoid using non-descriptive anchor text (for example, read more, click here, etc).</li>\n<li>Link to relevant, deep pages.</li>\n<li>Use breadcrumb navigation on every page</li>\n<li>Monitor your inbound links through Google Webmaster Tools.</li>\n<li>Avoid multiple links to the same page from a single page.</li>\n<li>Less links= More authority per link.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The most common practice of showing “related links” or “tags” at the end of a page or in a sidebar is done to thematically relate one page to another. </p>\n<p><b>TIP:</b> Linking back your main landing page for a certain keyword from other web pages with similar tags will help you in improving your ranking for that specific web page.</p>\n<h2>Off-Page Optimization</h2>\n<p>Off-Page SEO refers to your website’s overall “authority” on the web determined by what other websites say about your site. Off-page optimization is a long-term process and takes time to improve. Simply put, off page is all about your online reputation. Off page optimization includes acquiring backlinks to your page from the authority sites in your niche. Backlinks is the currency of any off-page strategy. And, unlike on-page optimization, off-page optimization efforts are not apparently visible on the webpage itself; it does the background work for a better search result.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/08/off_page_seo_diagram_vqwdf.gif\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>But, after the recent Google Panda and Penguin updates, off-page optimization scenario has drastically changed. Many effective old school practices became obsolete and negatively affected many big websites with high page ranks.Off page optimization effort can be grossly divided in two parts:</p>\n<h3>1. Acquiring Backlinks</h3>\n<p>Acquiring backlinks to your pages from higher authority sites is now more important than ever. Search engines treat link popularity as one of the key factors for a better search engine ranking. Though, link popularity is not the top ranking factor anymore, as it can easily be manipulated.  Now a days, search engines focus more on the quality of your content and the level of engagement on the site, over the number of links pointing towards your site. So, the success factor is not building a long list of inbound links but building a trail of quality links for your site. Creating quality content that informs and educates your target audience is more important than ever.</p>\n<p><b>TIP:</b> Getting a number of links from multiple domains relevant in your industry is the key. Buying backlinks from non-related domains won’t earn you goodwill in search engine results and can even penalize you.</p>\n<h3>2. Leveraging social interaction with your site</h3>\n<p>Use of social metrics or<a href=\"http://www.betaout.com/blog/how-to-build-community-around-online-news-and-scale-it/\"> social engagement</a>  as a ranking factor is an increasing trend. Besides backlinks, Google now gives prominence to social signals around your content. Whether it’s the number of people who tweet, ‘Like’, social bookmark, or “vote” via Google +1 for your content, your site’s social footprints has a direct relation with your rankings. SEO has now evolved into social.</p>\n<h3>3. Promote your content via social channels</h3>\n<p>Make sure to promote your content through multiple social media channels to obtain some social media traction. You can use multiple platforms to engage your audience, keeping the focus on the ones creating maximum buzz for you. There are various platforms at your exposure:</p>\n<h4>Facebook</h4>\n<p>Facebook is the social platform with maximum number of active users at this moment. You can share your content there but don’t use a promotional tone, rather keep it light as people come to Facebook mostly with an intention of socializing in a casual mood. Specially interesting and light topics with pictures get more attention in the form of Likes and Share on Facebook.</p>\n<h4>Twitter and LinkedIn</h4>\n<p>You can distribute your content on both these platforms. You can share your content in the form of an article, video, image or even in the form of a simple update.  You can <a href=\"http://www.betaout.com/blog/how-can-publishers-leverage-linkedin-to-increase-business/\">join relevant LinkedIn groups</a>  and share you articles there too. If you have content of great quality you’ll surely be able to create buzz around it.</p>\n<h4>Google+</h4>\n<p>It has become very important to share any content you create on Google+, as it is from the search engine provider itself. Recently, there is a lot of noise that Google+ has a indirect correlation with your website’s ranking in the search engine. Google also have introduced a new feature called <b>Google Authorship</b>. It shows  the picture and name of an author with his articles in Google search results. This has come across as a major factor to counter the duplicate content by giving weightage to the authors and the content they have created. An article from a popular author can get extra points for reliability, which can help in a better search engine ranking in future.</p>\n<h4>Pinterest</h4>\n<p>Pinterest is the latest social media sensation. The image sharing website allows you to share pictures from your post to appeal to your target audience.

Add social book markings</h3>\n<p>Social bookmarking is one of those old yet useful off-page SEO techniques being used from the pre-Panda and Penguin age. There are many sites like Tumbler, Stumbleupon, Reddit, Delicious, Digg being the most prominent ones, where people come in searching for different content  topics. You can add a social bookmarking panel to your website and share all the content you produce. Not just that, also try to participate in the discussion and regularly mark you presence with your comment and content.</p>\n<h3>5. Guest Blogging</h3>\n<p>Another way of acquiring strong back links in post Panda era is guest blogging. You have to create relevant and high quality content and submit to the blogs with higher page ranks. If your article contains real good stuffs it will get published and to do that you have to observe the content types and categories your target blogs are covering, it’s even great if there are some common or related categories both of you cater to. But remember, you should not do it just for the sake of getting back links and also submitting articles to substandard blog sites is not going to fetch you desired benefit.</p>\n<p>For a long term and successful search engine optimization strategy, you need to work on your site structure as well as on building your online reputation by getting backlinks and creating community around your content. And, ultimately, it boils down to creating interesting and informative content people would like to read and share. Content is still the King.</p>\n<p>Image Credit: <a style=\"font-size:15px\">CyberLinkMedia</a></p>", "categories": ["Blogging", "Publishing", "Off page SEO", "On page SEO", "Search Engine Optimization", "SEO"]}, {"title": "10 Proven Gamification Strategies for Publishers to Maximize Engagement", "link": "http://www.betaout.com/blog/10-proven-gamification-strategies-for-publishers-to-maximize-engagement/", "author": "Nandini Rathi", "publishedDate": "Fri, 23 Aug 2013 04:12:56 -0700", "contentSnippet": "Gamification isn’t “Plug &#38; Play.” To craft an effective&#160;gamification&#160;&#160;strategy, a significant amount of ...", "content": "<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/08/b04c2b454c1442d299c5aa0b233fb443_m7rsr.png\"></p>\n<p>Gamification isn’t “Plug &amp; Play.” To craft an effective <a href=\"http://www.betaout.com/blog/gamification-for-publishers/\">gamification</a>  strategy, a significant amount of thought must be put into understanding what will engage and motivate your users to perform specific actions and depict specific behavior to help you achieve your goals.  Check out what you need to consider to carve your own custom gamification strategy:-</p>\n<p><span></span><br>\n<h2>1. Know your Audience</h2>\n</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/08/whoaudience_400x223_btjzd.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Know what are the needs of your audience. Give them what they want and they might give you what you want. Remember, gamification is about adding value to your users and if your user is clueless about your gamification (PBL) mechanics, he/she will not feel motivated to be a part of your community. Your users must clearly know what is expected of them to earn different badges and move to the next level. Successful gamification program requires you to understand what motivates your audience.</p>\n<p>For example, some of your users may be motivated by social rewards while others are self-driven by accomplishment only.</p>\n<h2>2. Set Quantifiable Goals</h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/08/set_goals_re88d.jpg\"></p>\n<p>You need clear, quantifiable, goals before starting out with your gamification plan.</p>\n<p>One size doesn’t fit all. Every publication needs a custom-made gamification strategy tailored to its specific needs. </p>\n<p>For example, you might want to increase your email sign ups. So, your goal should be to achieve X number of email signups. And your gamification plan should be to gamify your email signup form so that readers who are not opting in are motivated to do so.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">You can have something like a loyalty club, wherein subscribers get access to exclusive articles, tips or free ebook if they signup. </span><a href=\"http://www.copyblogger.com/\" style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">CopyBlogger</a><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">  is doing it right. Convince and Convert too offers its subscribers one tip each day by signing up.</span></p>\n<p>If you want to build a comments community, your goal should be quantifiable to X number of comments. And your game design might involve gamifying popover forms to encourage readers to leave a comment and so on.</p>\n<p>If your goal is to increase engagement around your content, your game design should offer incentives to push users to complete certain tasks such as downloading a whitepaper or trend report, or watching a slideshow/top videos.</p>\n<p>Prioritize the actions you want your users to take to achieve your goals. And your gamification strategy should be designed with these quantifiable goals in mind. As Management expert Peter Drucker says, “If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it.”</p>\n<h2>3. Make your gamification funnel strong</h2>\n<p>Your gamification strategy should be designed to evolve with your reader. Design the user journey funnel: where they are, what they want to achieve and so on.</p>\n<p>It is important to define a purpose before implementing a gamification layer intended just for fun.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">Onboarding new users</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">Engagement – Increase user engagement</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">Retention – Turning them into brand evangelists</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In a gamification funnel, readers at every level have different needs and motivations. Your strategy should be designed to accommodate the needs &amp; desires of users at all levels.</p>\n<h2>4. Pick a good designer for badge design</h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/08/647c7085bdff40bbbaca5bebc876bee1_nxosn.png\"></p>\n<p>When it comes to game design, choosing a badge is one of the most important game dynamics in a game design. More often than not, people fail to realize the importance of beautiful badges.</p>\n<p>Design your badges like medals. Most of the gamification designs play around with medicore and poorly designed badges.</p>\n<p>But beautifying your badges isn’t all about it. Your badges need to be meaningful and be chosen carefully. Using badges inappropriately can doom a game play. Shiny Badges Rust The Same.</p>\n<h2>5. Analyze User Behavior Before You Start</h2>\n<p>Don’t adopt gamification for the heck of it. Think before making a leap. First, decide what is it that you need to gamify? Analyze your audience, and why they love or hate your website. Identify what motivates them. For example, how many pageviews a user does on your site on an average, what is the average time spent of a user on your site and so on. Once you know what you need to improve, you can work on how to improve it with gamification.</p>\n<p>You can design a gamification strategy to push that activity tasks by tying the desired actions with meaningful objectives and incentives. Once you are clear about why you need gamification and what do you want to achieve from it, you are all set for crafting a winning gamification strategy.</p>\n<p>The sole purpose of gamification is to bring in positive behavioral changes by motivating users in non-game scenarios and driving them to take specific actions.</p>\n<p>For example, your readers love to share your content but tehre is barely any interaction in your comment area. So, you need a gamification strategy to make it more fun for your loyal audience to interact with your content as well as with the other readers in the community.</p>\n<h2>6.Your Game Play Should be Fun</h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/08/91c8663c77c94ecd95d2b82208ca45f9_z2ykg.png\"></p>\n<p>“Games are powerful motivators, because they’re fun.”</p>\n<p>Gamification isn’t all about Point, Badges and Leaderboard. Your readers won’t care about your goals. Your game design must be playful &amp; fun to boost the user engagement so that he is never bored. It’s not all about earning points and rewards; how a user will reach that point is what will make him a brand evangelist. A fun and playful game design can enhance the whole experience.</p>\n<p><b>NOTE:</b> Adopting a fun approach doesn’t means that it should be the sole aim of your gamification strategy. A meaningful strategy must be designed with a purpose in mind.</p>\n<h2>7. Invest in Right Platform</h2>\n<p>Different users have different needs. For example, users coming from social networks have different expectations, users on your email list have different expectations and users coming from Google or other search engines have different set of needs. To design a multi-layer strategy you need to take professional help.</p>\n<h2>8. Integrate with Social Media</h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/08/c411bbbb708545a4b54d0b783a193112_xoel8.png\" style=\"width:600px;height:258px\"></p>\n<p>A gamification rewards programs should help you increase engagement by seamlessly integrating with the social networks. For example, users who sign in with a social login, can share their achievements and activity with their friends. People inherently want to show off to others what they have achieved.</p>\n<p>This will also help boost the activity and will encourage their friends to join in.</p>\n<p>Other successful publishers who have adopted gamification to increase the level of engagement within their website includes Moz by Rand Fishkin. The site uses game mechanics with “YouMoz” to improve its SEO, social and user engagement.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/08/6b03edded86848e696d6300aa84b6be5_emv4c.png\"></p>\n<p>A weight loss website Skinnyo.com has integrated social media deep in its gamification strategy. The weight loss community pits members against, friends, family and colleagues in weight loss challenges to motivate them to workout. You can compete with your friends, give them props for workouts they have done, and compete with your friends &amp; colleagues to lose weight in custom health challenges.</p>\n<h2>9. Show Users their Progress</h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/08/screen_shot_2013_08_23_at_1_1nflh.png\"></p>\n<p>Designers of meaningful gamification know that the way to make it a success is by striking a chord with the user, so your users personally feel motivated to play.</p>\n<p>A user who is internally motivated is more likely to find an activity to be meaningful than someone who is doing something just for the rewards. Gartner Burke says, “It may be increased status, social impact, more knowledge. Those types of intrinsic rewards are even more important than prizes and other extrinsic rewards.”</p>\n<p>The simple percentage completion progress bar on LinkedIn is another example. Each time you complete a new portion of your profile, there is a sense of progression &amp; goal completion. The progress bar is gamification at its best to encourage users to complete their profiles.</p>\n<h2>10. Analyze &amp; Optimize</h2>\n<p>The success of a gamification strategy depends on analyzing what works and what doesn’t. Your gamification platform should provide you with all the data and analytics to track your progress in real-time.</p>\n<p>It’s very important to analyze what motivates and drives a user to take certain action. <span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">Your platform should also allow you to test different versions of game mechanics to determine which gives you the best results.</span></p>\n<p>Your gamification platform should constantly help you with reports and analytics on how it is influencing user behavior and engagement.</p>\n<p>Tell us what do you think?

Evolution of the social networking sites and their increasing influence on content marketing, has changed the face of the publishing business drastically. These <a href=\"http://www.betaout.com/blog/the-art-of-building-communities-through-comments/\">social media communities</a> have absolutely revolutionized the way of content sharing and distribution.</p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">Few years back the content world was quite different from what we see now. Digg, Delicious, Stumbleupon etc. were the platforms publishers used to share their content on while Orkut, Facebook, Twitter were the sites where people used to purely socialize. LinkedIn was </span><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">primarily used for professional networking and job searching. </span></p>\n<p>Today Linkedin boasts a huge base of around 230 million professionals generating ten billion page views a month. Further a million groups of like minded people LinkedIn means real opportunity for publishers targeting business professionals..</p>\n<p><span></span><br>\n<h2><b>Understanding Linkedin’s Content Distribution System</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.45em\">LinkedIn has a diverged content distribution system generating around 10 billion page views a month. The features which are most useful for the publishers are:</span>\n</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><b>LinkedIn News feeds</b></h3>\n<p>LinkedIn being a professional platform gathers a huge crowd with a higher intelligence. Unlike other social platforms where users share casual things from their day to day life, LinkedIn is way more serious a community consisted of professional people like CEO’s, top level executives and leaders from the industries. LinkedIn in last few years has revamped itself as a content discovery platform. LinkedIn News feed which was initially cluttered with automatic tweets got a boost last year in July when Twitter shut down its automatic update of LinkedIn accounts of users. More and more people started posting richer content to LinkedIn following this update.</p>\n<p>Today, LinkedIn personalized news feed service gives you a better chance to get noticed by your professional friends, colleagues and influencers. LinkedIn’s Share button is a step in the right direction. Make sure your site features LinkedIn share button to help more eyeballs to your content.</p>\n<p>LinkedIn executive editor Dan Roth says, “The stories that have a tiny little bit of fire, we pour gasoline on them … When people start sharing your stories or commenting on stories, our algorithm starts noticing it.”\n</p>\n<h3><b>LinkedIn Groups</b></h3>\n<p>LinkedIn groups are the platforms where like minded people come and discuss topics of their common interest, search for help on particular issues and network between themselves. Joining a group gives you opportunity to connect and interact with a host of professionals from your target audience. Not only that, it can also prove to be extremely effective as a distribution channel for your content. You can either join an existing group or create a new one of your own.</p>\n<h4><b>Join to observe</b></h4>\n<p>There are almost a million groups already exist on LinkedIn, few hundred among them might be around the topic of your interest. Spend some time to sort and make a list of around 20 to 30 of them which are relevant for you and also high in terms of user activity. Join them and observe the pattern of discussions, comments and conversations to get the pulse and understand the group mechanics.</p>\n<h4><b>Participate to engage</b></h4>\n<p>Just joining groups will not serve the purpose; you have to be active to get noticed. Scan through the group digests and pick up few discussions to participate in. Comment only when you think your views can add value to the discussions or raise a potential debate to be farther commented on. Your motive should be engaging more and more people and get them interested in you and the content you create and share.</p>\n<h4><b>Initiate to influence</b></h4>\n<p>You can even initiate discussions on topics of your choice which are relevant for your group too. To do this you can also create a new group. Though it will take some initial hard work but once you start getting attention people would like to get personally connected with you and take more interest in the contents you share. It will position you as an industry influencer and thought leader. As the owner of a group, you get the privilege to prioritize your own articles over the others in terms of sharing it with the group.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/08/linkedin_wowcq.png\" alt=\"LinkedIn\" title=\"LinkedIn\" width=\"601\" height=\"369\"></p>\n<h2><b>Increase traffic and engagement</b></h2>\n<p>Previously,LinkedIn was known as a professional networking site used for building connections and job search. In the year 2010, it introduced ‘<a href=\"https://developer.linkedin.com/publishers\">inShare</a> ’, the social sharing button and stepped into the world of content. In the initial days only few big publishers like Huffington post, Bloomberg.com, Forbes.com integrated this to their sites. With time LinkedIn started generating more referral traffic at par with other social sharing sites. </p>\n<p>In fact the referral traffic through Linked has been seen getting multiplied by many folds. As par Mark Kaufman (former avp, Audience development, CNET), “CNET  has seen extraordinary increases in LinkedIn traffic- up to ten fold increase!”, Sara Marshal from BBC also had similar experience, “Traffic from LinkedIn to BBC News jumps ten folds in six months.” </p>\n<p>LinkedIn share also drives good click backs. LinkedIn not only channels good traffic but the visitors generate higher page views compared to other social networking sites. Bridget Jones of Business Insider says, “LinkedIn referral users have a higher number of page views per session and a lower bounce rate than the site average.”</p></p>", "categories": ["Blogging", "Content Operation", "Editors", "Online Newsroom", "Publishing", "content marketing", "linkedin", "LinkedIn for Publishers", "Social media", "social media marketing"]}, {"title": "What Publishers Need to Know About Gamification", "link": "http://www.betaout.com/blog/gamification-for-publishers/", "author": "Nandini Rathi", "publishedDate": "Fri, 16 Aug 2013 05:18:12 -0700", "contentSnippet": "The biggest misconception about gamification is that it’s all about games.

But it isn’t about games per se. Gamification is defined as the design approach for the application of game mechanics to non-game context. But to put it simply, gamification is the art of turning mundane into an engaging experience.</p>\n<p>The “gamification” concept was derived from how people act and interact in gamified environments and the technique was applied to improve the user experience and user engagement in non-game scenarios.</p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p>The purpose of gamification is to drive behavioral changes by satisfying fundamental human needs and desires for reward, status and achievement through game mechanics like points, level and badges.</p>\n<h1>Game Mechanics in simple words</h1>\n<h2>Points</h2>\n<p>Points help in establishing a reputation and earn intrinsic and extrinsic rewards in a gamified system. One of the easiest ways to get started with gamification is through a point driven system. You can award points to your readers based on their interaction with the content on your site. Points are also the basis for assigning badges and unlocking new levels.</p>\n<p>You can choose different types of points depending on the complexity of your gameplay.</p>\n<h3>1. Experience points (XP)</h3>\n<p>Experience points are given to a user depending upon his interaction with your content every time. The more you interact, the more experience points you earn. For example, every time you do an activity (commenting, sharing, etc) on the site, you get few points. Experience points go up each time, but typically can’t be redeemed for extrinsic rewards directly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://moz.com/\">SEOMoz</a>  use experience points to improve engagement and contribution.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/08/0dd66eba40c346aca59a57ba378150ae_jpk9v.png\"></p>\n<h3><b><br></b></h3>\n<h3><b>2. Redeemable points (RP) </b></h3>\n<p>Redeemable points can be converted into virtual rewards or prizes. Unlike experience points, redeemable points tend to fluctuate based on how much a user has redeemed his or her RPs. – (Image: <a href=\"http://www.cocobulbodyjewelry.com/images/reward_gift_redeem_example.jpg\">CocobulbodyJewelry</a> )</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/9fE9J7XxFJRtxZKjfKqkXQ3ZaARnd4WuCOXzX4kq5…8CMc_8QsMzcvl5Vm2DgQgfEPMBjUzLVgnQN7724LTPuLUCnnIfSUJbwmPeFTdzKPmk5b5my-a\" width=\"629px;\" height=\"288px;\"></p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>3. Skill points </h3>\n<p>Skill points are bonus points assigned for an activity. Skills points can be seen on many forums. Many publishers who also run a forum tend to use skill points in addition to Experience points.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/08/5cfc21b4261f4046ac65c4243665df59_yk9db.png\"></p>\n<p><a style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\" href=\"http://teamtreehouse.com/\">TeamTreehouse</a><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\"> </span> use skill points for its users so that potential employers can quickly     check Treehouse users categorized with their skills.</p>\n<h3><b><br></b></h3>\n<h3><b>4. Reputation points</b></h3>\n<p>Reputations points are one of the most important and complex metrics within a gamified system. Just as in real life, reputation points are earned for doing meaningful tasks.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/08/screen_shot_2011_06_17_at_12_efyvy.png\"></p>\n<p>For example, StackOverflow gives reputation points in exchange for helping other community members. The site uses reputation points as a hiring metrics</p>\n<h3><b><br></b></h3>\n<h3><b>5. Karma points</b></h3>\n<p>Karma points are used within a community to appreciate each other for a job well done. Karma points are introduced in a system to promote to encourage altruism among users.The difference between Karma and reputation point is that generally karma points can only a given by one user to another, and reputation points can be earned by doing some meaningful tasks.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/08/0020_06_reddit_karma_points_xl7zm.png\"></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\">Reddit, the popular social news website, gives Karma points when users submit content and other users upvote it or downvote it. Content receiving the most upvotes or karma points rises to the website’s home page.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:15px;line-height:1.45em\"><br></span></p>\n<h2>Badges</h2>\n<p>Badges are special achievements you earn for participating on the site and are fundamental to the success of every gamification strategy. Foursquare is a classic example for using badges to onboard millions of users. The Huffington Post became one of the first publishers to assign badges to its community members based on their activity on the site.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/PyOGUSJooG_aYJTQ_5vTtNs-63KGt5M5H_9J5CjK3…4lUnWBx0l1IQD7o-EQsrXEfmT4mkoSZDKFohDWQGsbjJa2Alkpm3gCaYOoei9LQSB8SCTNYWl\" width=\"500px;\" height=\"218px;\"></p>\n<p>Your badges should not stink. Badges create a perception and have the power to influence others. Deigning beautiful and limited edition badges can beautify the whole experience.</p>\n<p>Badges should be awarded for simple and less interesting tasks, but going on, badges should become scarcer. Follow a simple philosophy of give more badges to users who are less active and less badges to active users. Exclusive badges should be designed to reward team members for special achievements.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Leaderboards</h2>\n<p>Leaderboard is like a scorecard that shows a user where they currently stand within a gamified system.  It displays points, badges and status of users in a decreasing order. And the main purpose of designing a leaderboard is to get people’s competitive spirit out in order to maintain a healthy environment. Leaderboard allows users to compare against each other and get motivated to move up the leaderboard.</p>\n<p>There are several approaches to design a leaderboard. For example, you might want to show just the top users on your site (Absolute leaderboard). Though it has its disadvantages – it would be demotivating for the rest of the users who are way behind the top users in terms of points and badges.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.betaoutcdn.com/inbound/2013/08/c5efab698a5a4c12aa46a600c9498138_qo57f.png\" width=\"555px;\" height=\"491px;\"></p>\n<p>Another approach could be to implement relative leaderboards that shows a user’s position relative to his friends or other users doing similar amount of activity on the site.</p>\n<p><i>TIP:</i> If your site has thousands of active users then you can use relative leaderboard, but if your site is new to gamification – go for absolute leaderboard, otherwise the board will look empty to your users.</p>\n<h1>Why is it important for Publishers?</h1>\n<p>The rise of social networks has been the main enabler in bringing games mechanics and dynamics to attract new audiences online.  The success of Zynga’s virtual farmland FarmVille on Facebook unlocked the potential for online businesses including content businesses to shift its focus from consumption to engagement. Publishers in particular can use gamification to increase engagement, frequency of visits and user’s loyalty towards their sites.</p>\n<p>The Social media sites like Digg, Reddit, StumpleUpon and publishers like “The Huffington Post” have fused gamification techniques around content to drive millions of readers to their sites.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.betaout.com/blog/the-art-of-building-communities-through-comments/\">The Huffington Post</a> was the early adopter in using gamification techniques to trigger high-level of engagement by using badges and reward systems to encourage readers to perform a variety of activities on the site. Gamification is not all about extrinsic rewards, but it is more about intrinsic rewards, which motivates you to do simple and even dull tasks in an interesting way.</p>\n<p>Remember, Gamification isn’t a magic formula for success. It should be treated as a performance “enhancer” to drive the engagement around your content. Ultimately it boils down to creating interesting and informative content that people would like to share. Your gamification strategy should help you reach your set goals by motivating your visitors to do more on your site.</p>", "categories": ["Content Strategy", "Publishing", "amplify", "content", "gamification", "online communities", "publishers"]}];
